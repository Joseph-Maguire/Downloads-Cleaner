# Downloads-Cleaner
The Downloads Folder Cleaner is a simple yet effective Python application. This straightforward script cleans out a user's Downloads folder and organizes them into new folders created in the Home directory. 
If the folders in the Home directory already exist prior to running the application, the Downloads Cleaner will simply organize the files into the existing folders. Any duplicate files are moved accordingly.
